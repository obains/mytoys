## Python coding challenge

The challenge consists of scraping two websites and comparing the prices of Lego products.

Scraper.py runs the web scraper, which then creates two CSV files with the scraped data from that day.

The Analysis Jupyter Notebook then analyses the data.
Graphics are fully interactive and are made using plotly. 
To view them, either download the notebook and run it locally, or [use this nbviewer link for a static rendering](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/obains/mytoys/blob/b1842b9db95efc63d00dc9c12de0ed6b53b79b53/analysis.ipynb).
